## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* All extra libraries to be imported are listed in the Jupyter Notebook. Pandas and Scikit-learn must be upgraded to the most recent version.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of this project, which is the capstone project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program, is to identify patterns of behaviour of customers purchasing through the Starbucks app. By analysing the response of each demographic group to the various offers it is possible to personalize marketing towards each customer and consequently to positively influence their purchasing behaviour.
